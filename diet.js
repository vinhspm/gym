        <h2>Eat More Food</h2>
        <img src="/diet/giphy.gif" width="700cm" height="400cm" alt="">
        <p>You need to eat more calories than your body burns to gain weight. Don’t go by feeling since it’s easy to overestimate your calorie intake. Instead start by tracking everything you eat. Find out how many calories you need to gain weight. Then consistently eat more calories.</p>
        <p>Good calorie calculators will suggest about 16kcal/lb of body-weight to maintain your weight. For the 135lb/60kg skinny guy that’s about 2112kcal/day. This number doesn’t need to be 100% accurate. You’re just looking for a starting point and will adapt your food intake based on your progress.</p>
        <p>Add 500 calories per day to gain weight. For the 60kg/135lb skinny guy 2112 maintenances calories becomes 2612kcal/day. Round this down to 2600kcal to keep things simple – this isn’t surgery, and the calories on food labels aren’t 100% accurate anyway.&nbsp;Ballparking it is fine.</p>
        <p>If you want to gain weight fast&nbsp;and don’t care about gaining some extra belly fat, add 1000kcal/day. So for the skinny 60kg/135lb guy,&nbsp;that’s 3100kcal/day. It’s however easier&nbsp;to start with 500kcal/day extra so your body has time to get used to eating more food.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind it’s your daily average calorie intake at the end of the week and month that determines if you’ll gain weight. If you eat 3100kcal today but then only 1500kcal the next three days, you’re unlikely to gain weight. You have to consistently eat more food. Hit your&nbsp;numbers every day.</p>
        <p>It’s normal to struggle to eat your calories every day in the&nbsp;beginning. But your stomach will stretch as you eat more food. Within two weeks you’ll have an easier time eating your calories. You’ll actually get more hungry.&nbsp;But the first week is usually the hardest. You may have to push yourself to eat.</p>
        <h3><span id="Track_Progress">Track Progress</span></h3>
        <p>Track your progress by weighing yourself&nbsp;every week. Do it the same time and day every time, ideally first thing on waking up, after you pee. Don’t weigh yourself every day. Your weight fluctuates daily based on your stomach/bowel content, water/salt intake, etc. This will confuse you.</p>
        <p>Aim for 0.5kg/1lb of weight gain a week. Skinny guys who start malnourished often gain more the first weeks. But this is mostly because of increased bowel/stomach content, and extra water weight. Remember you can <a href="https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#Rate_of_Muscle_Gain" data-wpel-link="internal">gain max 0.5lb of lean muscle a week on average</a>.</p>
        <p>If you gain weight, keep eating the same amount of calories. If you don’t gain weight for two weeks, despite eating the same amount of calories every day, then bump your calorie intake. Add another 500kcal/day and check what happens. Repeat until you gain weight.</p>
        <p>This means the food intake that makes you gain your first 10kg/20lb won’t make you gain your next 10kg/20lb. Skinny men&nbsp;with less muscle need less calories than big and strong guys because they burn less calories at rest. The bigger you get,&nbsp;the more you&nbsp;have to eat to get even bigger.</p>
        <h3><span id="Eat_More_Protein">Eat More Protein</span></h3>
        <p>Eat 0.82g of protein per pound of body-weight per day for&nbsp;<a href="https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/" data-wpel-link="internal">muscle building</a> and <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Recovery" data-wpel-link="internal">recovery</a>. That’s about 100g of protein per day for the 132lb/60kg skinny guy. You can easily hit these numbers by eating a whole source of protein with every meal. Here are some of the best proteins sources&nbsp;for gaining weight:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Steaks, ground round</li>
          <li>Chicken breast, chicken thighs</li>
          <li>Tuna, salmon, mackerel,&nbsp;sardines</li>
          <li>Yoghurt, cottage cheese,&nbsp;milk</li>
          <li>Whole eggs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The macronutrient ratio of carbs and fats matters little for gaining weight. What matters most is that you eat more calories than your body burns. Hit your 0.82g of protein per lb of body-weight per day for muscle&nbsp;building. Then fill the rest up with carbs and fats so you hit your calories. Keep it simple.</p>
          <p>Don’t make the mistake of avoiding carbs and/or fats&nbsp;because you’re afraid of gaining fat. Carbs and fats have more calories than proteins. If you avoid them, you’re making it harder and more expensive to gain weight. Most people can’t gain muscle and weight without gaining some fat anyway.</p>
          <h3><span id="Eat_MoreMeals">Eat More&nbsp;Meals</span></h3>
          <img src="/diet/eat.jfif" width="700cm" height="400cm" alt="">
          <p>Let say you need 3500kcal/day to gain weight. It’s easier to eat 5 meals of 700kcal than&nbsp;three meals of 1150kcal. Your stomach is small from eating like a bird for years. Bigger meals force you to push yourself to finish your meal, and&nbsp;can make you feel like throwing up. Eat small&nbsp;meals instead.</p>
          <p>You need <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Sleep" data-wpel-link="internal">eight hours of sleep</a>. That leaves you 16 hours to eat. It’s easier to gain weight if you spread your meals over 16 hours. Your meals can be smaller, your stomach has a break inbetween, and you don’t feel stuffed all the time. Here’s&nbsp;an example meal plan to gain weight…</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast at 7am&nbsp;– oats, raisins, yoghurt, milk</li>
            <li>Snack at 10am – mixed nuts, banana</li>
            <li>Lunch at 1pm – chicken, pasta, parmesan</li>
            <li>Snack at 4pm – dried fruits</li>
            <li>Dinner at 7pm – steak with potatoes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><span id="Training">Training</span></h2>
            <img src="/diet/work.gif" width="700cm" height="400cm" alt="">
            <p>Lifting weights triggers&nbsp;your body to <a href="https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/" data-wpel-link="internal">build muscle mass</a>. Your body uses the food you eat to recover your muscles and build new ones. Lifting also increases your appetite&nbsp;which helps you eat more.</p>
            <p>If you don’t lift weights or don’t do it correctly, then all the excess food you’re eating will be stored&nbsp;to fat. This is what happens to people who eat more calories than they burn. Their body stores the extra energy&nbsp;as fat, usually around their belly. You want to go from skinny to muscular, not chubby.</p>
            <p>You must therefore lift. Here are the basic rules of&nbsp;lifting for skinny guys. If you’re&nbsp;hardgainer or ectomorph like me, this is the only&nbsp;way to lift&nbsp;that will increase your body-weight naturally…</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free Weights. More effective than machines because you must balance the weight yourself. Safer because you control how the bar moves. More effective than dumbbells because the weight is heavier, and you can add as little as 0.5kg/1lb per workout.</li>
              <li>Compound Exercises. <a href="https://stronglifts.com/squat/" data-wpel-link="internal">Squats</a>, <a href="https://stronglifts.com/deadlift/" data-wpel-link="internal">Deadlifts</a>, <a href="https://stronglifts.com/bench-press/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bench</a>, <a href="https://stronglifts.com/overhead-press/" data-wpel-link="internal">Press</a>, <a href="https://stronglifts.com/barbell-row/" data-wpel-link="internal">Rows</a>. These exercises work several muscles at the same time, with the heaviest weights. They trigger maximum strength and muscle growth in your entire body. The big fives must be the bulk of your routine.</li>
              <li><a href="https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#ProgressiveOverload" data-wpel-link="internal">Progressive Overload</a>. Always try to lift more weight than last time. This forces your body to gain in strength and muscle mass to lift the heavier weights you’re exposing&nbsp;it to.&nbsp;You can’t build muscle if you lift the same weight all the time. You must <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#progression" data-wpel-link="internal">add weight</a>.</li>
              <li>Proper Form. You must work&nbsp;your muscles through a complete range of motion for proper muscle development. Half Squats give you&nbsp;half the gains. Proper form also prevents injuries and help you lift heavier so you gain more strength and muscle mass.</li>
              <li>Rest. Muscles need rest to recover from your workouts. They can’t grow if you train them every day with gazillion of exercises. Skinny guys don’t need more than three full body workouts a week.&nbsp;Doing more won’t make you&nbsp;gain weight. Eating more calories will.</li>
